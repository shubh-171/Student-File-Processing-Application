# Student File Processing Application
This project involves the design and development of a Student Information Processing System as part of my Software Engineering course. The system is designed to handle student-related data efficiently, providing functionalities such as managing student information, course enrollment, and academic performance tracking.

# Features

**Student Registration**: Adds new students with essential details such as name, ID, date of birth, etc.

**Course Management**: Add, update, and remove courses.

**Enrollment**: Students can enroll in courses, and the system tracks their enrollment status.

**Grade Tracking**: Record and display student grades for each course.

# Technologies Used

Java: The core programming language used for implementing the software.

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): 

The system follows OOP principles, including:

**Encapsulation**: Data and behavior are bundled together into classes. For example, Student class encapsulates student-related data and operations.

**Abstraction**: The internal workings of data processing and management are abstracted behind well-defined methods, allowing for simpler usage by other components or users.

# Design and Architecture

The system follows a modular design approach, where different classes handle different aspects of the system. The architecture follows a layered structure, ensuring separation of concerns and ease of maintenance.

# Key components:

**Student Class**: Contains attributes like name, student ID, and courses enrolled.

**Course Class**: Manages the course-related data, including course name, code, and enrolled students.

**Enrollment Class**: Handles the logic for student enrollment in various courses and tracks grades.
