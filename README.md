# Student File Processing Application
This project involves the design and development of a Student Information Processing System as part of my Software Engineering course. The system is designed to handle student-related data efficiently, providing functionalities such as managing student information, course enrollment, and academic performance tracking.

# Features

**Student Registration**: Adds new students with essential details such as name, ID, date of birth, etc.

**Course Management**: Add, update, and remove courses.

**Enrollment**: Students can enroll in courses, and the system tracks their enrollment status.

**Grade Tracking**: Record and display student grades for each course.

# SDLC Concepts Used

In the development of the Student Information Processing System, I followed the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) principles to ensure structured, efficient, and high-quality delivery of the project.
The key SDLC concepts used are:

**Requirement Analysis**: Understanding and gathering the requirements for managing student information, course enrollment, and grade tracking.
**System Design**: Creating a system design that incorporates a modular approach, with a focus on object-oriented principles such as encapsulation and abstraction for maintainability and scalability.
**Implementation**: Writing the Java code that implements the design, ensuring proper class structures, and incorporating core functionalities like student registration, course management, and grade tracking.
**Testing**: Testing individual components to ensure that each function, such as student enrollment and grade recording, works as expected.
**Deployment**: Compiling and running the code to provide the system's core functionalities for user interaction.
**Maintenance**: The system is designed to be flexible for future updates, such as adding a graphical user interface (GUI) or integrating a database for persistent storage.

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): 

The system follows OOP principles, including:

**Encapsulation**: Data and behavior are bundled together into classes. For example, Student class encapsulates student-related data and operations.

**Abstraction**: The internal workings of data processing and management are abstracted behind well-defined methods, allowing for simpler usage by other components or users.

# Design and Architecture

The system follows a modular design approach, where different classes handle different aspects of the system. The architecture follows a layered structure, ensuring separation of concerns and ease of maintenance.

# Key components:

**Student Class**: Contains attributes like name, student ID, and courses enrolled.

**Course Class**: Manages the course-related data, including course name, code, and enrolled students.

**Enrollment Class**: Handles the logic for student enrollment in various courses and tracks grades.
